What is an incremental backup anyway?
======================================

An "incremental backup" is a backup, which is done in levels. At the lowest
level, you make a full backup. This is level 0 here. People should make a level
0 backup at least once a month. In higher levels L , you just make the backup
of files, which were changed since the last backup of level L-1. So in your
backup of level 1 you save all your files, that were changed since your last
backup level 0. If you make a level 0 backup once a month, your level 1 backup
should be placed for once a week. For level 2, you can make it once a day, and
every file changed since last the backup of last week, will be save.

Restoring a backup:

When you need then to restore a backup (I wish you, that never happens), you
just need to restore your last level 0, then the last level 1 and then the last
level 2 backup.

Of course you can have more levels, if you want (maybe level 0: yearly, level
1: monthly, level 2: weekly, level 3: daily and level 4 hourly), but 3 levels
should be enough to almost everybody.

So, have a nice backup.

How it works?
=============

It just makes a backup of level X (should be given as a line parameter), in the
directory indicated in /etc/dump-backup.rc and backups all directories listed
in /etc/dump-backup.dirs.

It creates per backup following files in the respective levelX directory:

backup-DATE	    - The Backup files
.index-DATE	    - The index of the archive backup-DATE
.files-DATE	    - The files in the directories at backup time
.changed-DATE	    - The files changed since the last Backup of LEVEL-1
.deleted-DATE	    - The files deleted since the last Backup of LEVEL-1
.new-DATE	    - The newer files since the last Backup of LEVEL-1

Installation:
==============
Automagic Installation:
-----------------------
Just run the script as root like:
./dump-backup.sh --config
and follow the instruction.

You still have to make steps 6-9 of the manual installation

Manual Installation:
--------------------
1. Create your backup directory (e.g. /usr/local/backup), this is the place
    were the backup files are placed;
   
   mkdir /usr/local/backup
   
2. Install the shell script "dump-backup.sh" in a bin directory (e.g.
    /usr/local/bin)

    cp dump-backup.sh /usr/local/bin
    
3. Copy the configuration files to the /etc/dump-backup (create it first)
    directory:

    cp dump-backup.rc dump-backup.dirs dump-backup.exc /etc/dump-backup
    
4. Modify the file dump-backup.rc and set the variables BACKUPDIR to what you
    put in (1.) and LEVELTIMES accordingly to your needs; LEVELTIMES tells how
    long is a file to be kept for backup level 0, 1, 2,...

5. Write in /etc/dump-backup.dirs the list of directories that you want to
    backup, at best one per line;

6. Make a level 0 backup with "dump-backup.sh 0"

7. Make a level 1 backup with "dump-backup.sh 1"

8. Make a level 2 backup with "dump-backup.sh 2"

9. Configure cron to make one backup of level 0, 1, and 2 once a month, a week,
    a day (respectively). Normally you just need to place a little script in
    /etc/cron.{daily,monthly,weekly}

Possible cron-script:
=====================
#!/bin/sh
/usr/local/bin/dump-backup.sh 0
#                             ^-> Change this value to the 0 in monthly,
#                                                          1 in weekly,
#                                                          2 in daily

I have some code from (I think) the German magazine "Linux User", but I'm not
sure of it, because I've lost the magazine. So if you know were the "difffiles"
and "getfiles" script were first published, tell me, so I can put the right
information here. It is also possible, that the magazine was "Linux Magazine"
or "c't".
